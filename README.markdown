##Module Description

This module installs and configures Apache Zookeeper quorum cluster. It expects list of hostnames, where zookeeper should be running. Zookeeper IDs will be generated according to the ordering of these hostnames.

Optionally the security based on Kerberos can be enabled.

Tested on:

* **Debian 7/wheezy**: Cloudera distribution (tested with CDH 5.3.0/5.5.1/5.7.1, Zookeeper 3.4.5)
* **Debian 8/jessie**: BigTop distribution (BigTop 1.2.0, Zookeeper 3.4.6)
* **Ubuntu 14/trusty**
* **RHEL 6/7 and clones**: Cloudera distribution (tested with CDH 5.4.2, Zookeeper 3.4.5)

##Setup

<a name="what-zookeeper-affects"></a>
###What cesnet-zookeeper module affects

* Packages: zookeeper server package
* Alternatives:
 * alternatives are used for */etc/zookeeper/conf* in Cloudera
 * this module switches to the new alternative by default on Debian, so the Cloudera original configuration can be kept intact
* Files modified:
 * */etc/zookeeper/conf\**
 * */var/lib/zookeeper/\**
* Secret files (keytab): ownerships and permissions modified
* Java system properties set for Zookeeper:
 * *java.security.auth.login.config*
 * *zookeeper.security.auth\_to\_local*

###Setup Requirements

There are several known or intended limitations in this module.

Be aware of:

* **Repositories** - see cesnet-hadoop module Setup Requirements for details

* **Secure mode**: keytab must be prepared in */etc/security/keytabs/zookeeper.service.keytab* (see *realm* parameter)

<a name="beginning-with-zookeeper"></a>
###Beginning with Zookeeper

**Example**: one-machine zookeeper quorum without security:

    class{'zookeeper':
      hostnames => [ $::fqdn ],
    }
    include ::zookeeper::server

It is recommended to have at least three or more (odd-numbered) zookeeper machines. All zookeeper hostnames must be specified in *hostnames* and the order must be the same across all the nodes.

<a name="usage"></a>
##Usage

**Example**: Setup with security:

    class{'zookeeper':
      hostnames => [ $::fqdn ],
      realm     => 'MY.REALM',
    }
    include ::zookeeper::server

The keytab file must be available at */etc/security/keytabs/zookeeper.service.keytab*.

Note: you can consider removing or changing property *zookeeper.security.auth\_to\_local*:

    properties => {
      'zookeeper.security.auth_to_local' => '::undef',
    }

Default value is valid for principal names according to Hadoop documentation at [http://hadoop.apache.org/docs/stable/hadoop-project-dist/hadoop-common/SecureMode.html](http://hadoop.apache.org/docs/stable/hadoop-project-dist/hadoop-common/SecureMode.html) and it is needed only with cross-realm authentication.

<a name="superuser"></a>
###Superuser Access

It is recommended to set super user credentials (for example to be able to restore bad ACLs).

####Get the digest string:
(replace $PASSWORD by real password)

    export ZK_HOME=/usr/lib/zookeeper
    java -cp $ZK_HOME/lib/*:$ZK_HOME/zookeeper.jar org.apache.zookeeper.server.auth.DigestAuthenticationProvider super:$PASSWORD

####Use the digest in *properties*:

    class{'zookeeper':
      hostnames  => [ $::fqdn ],
      realm      => 'MY.REALM',
      properties => {
        zookeeper.DigestAuthenticationProvider.superDigest => 'super:XXXXX',
      },
    }
    include ::zookeeper::server

####Using in the client:

    zooclient-cli
      addauth digest super:PASSWORD

###Classes

* [**`zookeeper`**](#parameters): Configuration class for Zookeeper
* **`zookeeper::client`**: Zookeeper client
* `zookeeper::client::config`: Zookeeper client configuration
* `zookeeper::client::install`: Zookeeper client installation
* `zookeeper::client::service`: Stub class
* `zookeeper::common::config`: Zookeeper common configuration
* `zookeeper::common::postinstall`: Preparation steps after installation
* `zookeeper::params`: Zookeeper module parameters
* **`zookeeper::server`**: Zookeeper node
* `zookeeper::server::config`: Zookeeper server configuration
* `zookeeper::server::install`: Zookeeper node installation
* `zookeeper::server::service`: Launch zookeeper service

<a name="parameters"></a>
###Module Parameters

####`alternatives`

Switches the alternatives used for the configuration. Default: 'cluster' (Debian) or undef.

It can be used only when supported (for example with Cloudera distribution).

####`hostnames`

Array of zookeeper nodes hostnames. Default: undef.

####`myid`

ID of zookeeper server in the quorum. Default: undef (=autodetect).

*myid* is the ID number of the zookeeper server in the quorum. It's the number starting from 1 and it must be unique for each node.

By default, the ID is generated automatically as order of the node hostname (*::fqdn*) in the *hostnames* array.

####`properties`

Generic properties to be set for the zookeeper cluster. Default: undef.

Some properties are set automatically, "::undef" string explicitly removes given property. Empty string sets the empty value.

####`realm`

Enables security and specifies Kerberos realm to use. Default: ''.

Empty string disables the security.

With enabled security there are required:

  * configured Kerberos (*/etc/krb5.conf*)
  * */etc/security/keytab/zookeeper.service.keytab* (on zookeeper nodes)
